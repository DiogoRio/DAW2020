            <b> Cultivation </b>

            <p>
                Wisteria, especially Wisteria sinensis, is very hardy and fast-growing. 
                It can grow in fairly poor-quality soils, but prefers fertile, moist, 
                well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun. It can be propagated via hardwood 
                cutting, softwood cuttings, or seed. However, specimens grown from seed can 
                take decades to bloom; for this reason, gardeners usually grow plants that 
                have been started from rooted cuttings or grafted cultivars known to flower well.

            </p>

            <p>

                Another reason for failure to bloom can be excessive fertilizer (particularly nitrogen). 
                Wisteria has nitrogen fixing capability (provided by Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules), 
                and thus mature plants may benefit from added potassium and phosphate, but not nitrogen. 
                Finally, wisteria can be reluctant to bloom before it has reached maturity. 
                Maturation may require only a few years, as in Kentucky wisteria, or nearly twenty, as in 
                Chinese wisteria. Maturation can be forced by physically abusing the main trunk, root pruning, or drought stress.

            </p>

            <p>

                Wisteria can grow into a mound when unsupported, but is at its best when allowed to clamber up a tree, pergola,
                wall, or other supporting structure. Whatever the case, the support must be very sturdy, because mature wisteria
                can become immensely strong with heavy wrist-thick trunks and stems. These can collapse latticework, crush thin
                wooden posts, and even strangle large trees. Wisteria allowed to grow on houses can cause damage to gutters,
                downspouts, and similar structures.

            <p>

                Wisteria flowers develop in buds near the base of the previous year's growth, so pruning back side shoots to the
                basal few buds in early spring can enhance the visibility of the flowers. If it is desired to control the size of
                the plant, the side shoots can be shortened to between 20 and 40 cm long in midsummer, and back to 10 to 20 cm in
                the fall. Once the plant is a few years old, a relatively compact, free-flowering form can be achieved by pruning
                off the new tendrils three times during the growing season in the summer months. The flowers of some varieties
                are edible, and can even be used to make wine. Others are said to be toxic.Careful identification
                by an expert is strongly recommended before consuming this or any wild plant.

                Chinese wisteria was brought to the United States for horticultural purposes in 1816, while Japanese wisteria was 
                introduced around 1830.Because of its hardiness and tendency to escape cultivation, these non-native wisterias 
                are considered invasive species in many parts of the U.S., especially the Southeast, due to their ability to overtake
                and choke out other native plant species.
