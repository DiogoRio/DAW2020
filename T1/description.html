            <b> Description </b>

            <p>
                Wisterias climb by twining their stems around any available support
                . W. floribunda (Japanese wisteria) twines clockwise when viewed from above, 
                while W. sinensis twines counterclockwise. This is an aid in identifying the 
                two most common species of wisteria.They can climb as high as 20 m (66 ft) 
                above the ground and spread out 10 m (33 ft) laterally. The world's largest 
                known wisteria is in Sierra Madre, California, measuring more than 
                1 acre (0.40 ha) in size and weighing 250 tons. Planted in 1894,
                it is of the 'Chinese lavender' variety.

                The leaves are alternate, 15 to 35 cm long, pinnate, with 9 to 19 leaflets. 
                The flowers are produced in pendulous racemes 10 to 80 cm long, similar to 
                those of the genus Laburnum, but are purple, violet, pink or white. There 
                is no yellow on the leaves. Flowering is in spring (just before or as the 
                leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American 
                species and W. japonica. The flowers of some species are fragrant, most notably 
                W. sinensis. Wisteria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some 
                Lepidoptera species including brown-tail.

                The seeds are produced in pods similar to those of Laburnum, and, like the seeds 
                of that genus, are poisonous. All parts of the plant contain a saponin called 
                wisterin, which is toxic if ingested, and may cause dizziness, confusion, speech problems, 
                nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, diarrhea and collapse.There is debate over whether the 
                concentration outside of the seeds is sufficient to cause poisoning. Wisteria seeds have 
                caused poisoning in children and pets of many countries, producing mild to severe 
                gastroenteritis and other effects.
